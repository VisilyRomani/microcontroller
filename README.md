# Backroom's Escape Room Microcontroller Code

## D1-RF

D1-RF is code for the MFRC522 readers on the WeMos D1 revision 2. This uses multiple readers and compares the rfid tags to the solution which is a spesific tag to reader with SPI standard.

```
Notes
- Each reader needs 13-26 mA/3.3V DC so project needs external power for each reader

```

#### Update
- Will need to add button to solve puzzle in-case something goes wrong.
